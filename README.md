> Providing property owners and their tenants the transparency, accountability & efficiency needed to build trust in an opaque industry.

---

#  Summary
The property ownership & rental industry is a multi-sided ecosystem with outdated processes, broken promises, gate keeping and a learned lack of transparency & trust between all parties involved. 

Our goal with this hackathon project is to make a case to revitalize the space in a way that is beneficial for property owners and tenants alike; by having incentives to participate fairly and having the visibility into key transactions, we can help rebuild the trust necessary in this industry.
